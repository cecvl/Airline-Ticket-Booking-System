provide 4 choices using switch case in C programming.
first choice will be booking a seat. call a function that shows 3 destinations 
namely Mombasa, Kisumu, Eldoret, provide an option for invalid input.
store the destination in a struct.if they choose any, call a function that
shows 3 different times(10am,2pm and 5pm) and prompt the user to choose. store the 
time chosen as a string in the same struct. take user input for
departure date(day/month/year) as intgers.call a function that takes user details (name,
age, ID/passport number , phone number) and store in the same struct.
ask if they will book another. go through the whole booking process if they say yes.
second user's details will be stored in a separate struct.finish by calling a function that prints 
the tickets and the cost combined if the user booked more than two tickets.

second choice was reserving a seat. call the function that shows 3 destinations 
namely Mombasa, Kisumu, Eldoret, provide an option for invalid input.
store the destination in a reservation struct.if they choose any, call a function that
shows 3 different times(10am,2pm and 5pm) and prompt the user to choose. store the 
time chosen as a string in the same struct.  take user input for
departure date(day/month/year) as intgers.call the function that takes user details (name,
age, ID/passport number , phone number) and store in the same struct.
ask if they will book another. go through the whole booking process if they say yes.
second user's details will be stored in a separate struct. finish by calling a function that prints 
the tickets and the cost combined if the user booked more than two tickets.

third choice in the case statement will be booking a return ticket. if they choose this,
call a function that checks if the user first name is in any struct in the csv file.
if yes , call a function that shows 3 destinations 
namely Mombasa, Kisumu, Eldoret, provide an option for invalid input.
if they choose any,store the destination in a struct and call a function that
shows 3 different times(10am,2pm and 5pm) and prompt the user to choose. store the 
time chosen as a string in the same struct. take user input for
departure date(day/month/year) as intgers.call the function that takes user details (name,
age, ID/passport number , phone number) and store in the same struct.
ask if they will book another. go through the whole reservation process if they say yes.
second user's details will be stored in a separate struct.finish by calling a function that prints 
the tickets and the cost combined if the user booked more than two tickets.

fourth choice was to exit the program.
